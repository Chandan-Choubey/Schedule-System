# Admin Dashboard Application

## Overview

This application is an Admin Dashboard that allows for managing user availability and scheduling sessions. It is designed to handle user availability data and sessions efficiently with a user-friendly interface. The system supports adding, editing, and deleting availability, as well as scheduling and managing sessions.

## Features

- User availability management
- Session scheduling and management
- Dynamic form handling
- Real-time updates and error handling

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- React.js: Used for building the user interface and handling state management.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the components with a modern, responsive design.
- React Router: For handling client-side routing and navigation.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling API requests and application logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user availability and session data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB, providing schema-based solutions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/admin-dashboard.git
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd admin-dashboard/frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following environment variables:**

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd admin-dashboard/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:**

   ```
   MONGO_URI=""
   PORT=8000
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend.

2. **Login:**

   Ensure that you are authenticated by including a valid token in the local storage.

3. **Manage Availability:**

   Use the “Manage Your Availability” section to add, edit, and delete availability slots.

4. **Schedule Sessions:**

   Select a user and schedule sessions using the “Session Form” section.

## Design Choices

- **React.js** was chosen for the frontend due to its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **Node.js** with **Express.js** was selected for the backend to provide a scalable and performant API.
- **MongoDB** was used for its flexibility and ease of integration with Node.js.

## Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data is protected, and authentication tokens are handled securely.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and handling mechanisms are implemented for both frontend and backend.
- **Responsiveness**: The UI is designed to be responsive using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a good user experience across devices.

## Development

- **Code Quality**: Follow best practices for code structure, including modularization and clear function definitions.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure functionality and reliability.
- **Documentation**: Keep the documentation up to date with the latest changes and features.
